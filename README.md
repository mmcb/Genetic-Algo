# Genetic-Algo


This project is based on the ideas in a paper by Michael Scott Brown, Michael J. Pelosi, and Henry Dirska titled "Dynamic-Radius Species-Conserving Genetic Algorithm for the Financial Forecasting of Dow Jones Index Stocks" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236085839.


The goal of this project is to choose an optimized portfolio of ten stocks from the Dow Jones. To accomplish this, I will implement the Genetic Search Algorithm.
From the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones, the Algorithm will choose ten stocks based on the fitness function that takes into account daily returns. Thereafter, the batch of ten stocks will be picked with the probability proportional to their respective fitness score.
